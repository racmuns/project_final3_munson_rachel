# Plugins
* [Image Slider] (http://packetcode.com/article/jquery-image-slider-tutorial)

This plugin is placed on my home page to display the photos of the chefs at the restaurant. As explained in the title, this plugin allows you to place a group of images in your code that slide in a "slide show effect" across your webpage.I used minimal transition effects, but kept the main intention of the plugin, which is to slide images, scrolling from one photo to the next. 

* [Tabs] (http://jqueryui.com/tabs/)

This was my favorite plugin to use. I decided to keep the text simple, so I used the tabs feature to display the hours of the restaurant. With this plugin, you can break up multiple sections of code that can be swapped (from tab to tab) so save space on a page. Think of it as an accordion!

* [Date Picker] (http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/)

The datepicker is tied to a standard form input field. I decided to use this feature for when someone wanted to make a reservation, and allow them to click on a date in the calendar to use the form. This was probably the most difficult plugin for me to implement, but I was pleased with the end result. In order to use the plugin interactively, simply focus on the input (click, or use the tab key) to open an interactive calendar in a small overlay. Once opened, choose a date, and click elsewhere on the page or hit the Esc key to close. If a date is chosen, feedback is shown as the input's value. It worked perfectly!
